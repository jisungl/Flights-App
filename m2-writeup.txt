4. The flight capacity check query used 'capacity' instead of 'num_seats' which caused errors.
   I noticed from the test outputs that gave "column 'capacity' not found" errors. I joined Flights
   and Aircraft_types and N_numbers to be able to reference num_seats. I had to fix this in my query
   and also the checkFlightCapacity function. 
   I found it convenient to actually read through the resulting errors in the terminal, seeing as they
   often tell us exactly what is wrong. Always trace the join path in your queries since the tables and 
   code have to be linked. Always verify queries evem if they don't crash the first time around
